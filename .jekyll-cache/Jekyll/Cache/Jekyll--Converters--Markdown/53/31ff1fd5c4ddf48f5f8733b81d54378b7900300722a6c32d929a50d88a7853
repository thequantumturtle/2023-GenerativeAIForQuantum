<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In this lecture, we will dive into the fundamental concept of qubits. We will explore how qubits differ from classical bits and how they allow for the representation of quantum information. We will also discuss the principles of superposition and entanglement, which are key properties of qubits that enable quantum computation.</p>
