I"Ó<p>Join us on June 22 as we explore the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. In this lecture, we will examine how LLMs are applied in various machine learning tasks, such as natural language processing, text generation, and sentiment analysis. We will also explore the intersection of LLMs with quantum computing, investigating the potential benefits and challenges of using LLMs in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning. Through practical examples and discussions, you will gain insights into the software aspects and implications of LLMs in these domains. Donâ€™t miss out on this exciting opportunity to learn about the diverse applications of LLMs!</p>
